Contained herein are scripts for the described Chemical Semantic Search (CheSS), alternative canonicalization prompt engineering method, and various analyses of the search results.

Due to the constraints on GitHub filesize:
- The database file "pubchem-9999810-512-token-compatible.txt" is not available
- The search results only include the top 1,000 results, rather than the entire database

If you wish to obtain copies of these files, please contact clayton.kosonocky@utexas.edu. We may host these files on a separate storage platform, in which case we will post a link here.
